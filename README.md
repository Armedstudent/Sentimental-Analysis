Welcome to the **Sentimental Analysis** repository! This project aims to build a model that classifies text into three categories: positive, negative, or neutral. By applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for preprocessing and machine learning methods for classification, we strive for accurate sentiment predictions across various text formats.

## Introduction

In today's digital age, understanding sentiment from text data is crucial. Businesses, researchers, and developers can gain insights into customer opinions, market trends, and social media sentiments. This repository focuses on building a robust sentiment analysis model that can handle diverse text inputs and provide reliable classifications.

## Features

- **Text Classification**: Classify text as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **NLP Techniques**: Utilize tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming for effective text preprocessing.
- **Machine Learning**: Implement various algorithms for sentiment classification.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface for easy interaction.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Detailed guides for installation, usage, and contribution.

## Technologies Used

This project employs a range of technologies to ensure effective sentiment analysis:

- **Python**: The primary programming language for development.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and data manipulation.
- **Pandas**: For data handling and analysis.
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**: For NLP tasks like tokenization and stemming.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Armedstudent/Sentimental-Analysis.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Sentimental-Analysis
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the setup script** (if applicable):

   ```bash
   python setup.py install
   ```

## Usage

To use the sentiment analysis model, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python sentiment_analysis.py --input "Your text here"
```

Replace `"Your text here"` with the text you want to analyze. The model will output the sentiment classification.

## Model Training

Training the sentiment analysis model involves several steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset containing labeled text samples.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data using NLP techniques. This includes:
   - Tokenization
   - Stopword removal
   - Stemming or lemmatization

3. **Feature Engineering**: Convert text data into numerical format using techniques like Bag of Words or TF-IDF.

4. **Model Selection**: Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machine).

5. **Training**: Fit the model on the training dataset.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model parameters for better performance.

## Evaluation

After training the model, evaluate its performance using metrics such as:

- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correctly classified instances.
- **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.
- **Recall**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

Use the following command to evaluate the model:

```bash
python evaluate_model.py
```
